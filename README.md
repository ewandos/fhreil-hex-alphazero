A _tabula rasa_ chess agent that follows from the Alpha Go Zero paper but is a slightly simpler. 

By "simpler", I mean that the only difference is that this agent does not use MCTS and instead uses Monte Carlo rollouts which are (1) easier to implement and (2) cleaner conceptually.

I do plan to implement MCTS in a future version, but for now Monte Carlo rollouts would suffice.

In this repo, we test the agent on two chess environments: tic-tac-toe and gobang.
