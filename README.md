# AlphaZero for Hex

Execute `hex_train_alphazero` to train a new model. The new `.pth` file will be created in the „trained_models“ folder, indicating the number of self-played games in the file name. Further, it is possible to manipulate the hyper-parameters in the script, like the number of games, the evaluation frequency, and the number of grad steps to update the policy-value network.

Execute `hex_alphazero_vs_human` to play a hex game against a trained model. To use a specific model, modify the filename in line 12 to match the desired model in the „trained_models“ folder. When executed, the script will initiate a new 5x5 hex game in the console, printing the board and the move probabilities after every step. AlphaZero will move first every time. To make a move enter two digits like „0,1“ to place a stone in the first row, second column.
