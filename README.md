# Alpha Zero

A chess agent that follows from the Alpha Go Zero paper but is a lot simpler. 

By "simpler", I mean that this agent does not use MCTS and instead uses Monte Carlo rollouts which are (1) easier to implement and (2) cleaner conceptually.

In this repo, we test the agent on two chess environments: tic-tac-toe and gobang.
